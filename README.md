# Business-Insights-360-Case-Study
This project aims to build an automated POWER BI dashboard that would help the Finance, Sales, Marketing and Supply Chain team of AtliQ Hardware in order to effectively analyze the data and drive business insights to incorporate data-powered decisions. 

Welcome to the business insights 360 data analysis case study as a part of the Portfolio Project of DataAnalyzer-Pooja.

# Problem Statement 
AtliQ Hardware (a hypothetical company) faces challenges in effectively using and gaining insights from their data. They rely on old excel files to analyze their data but this method is outdated and not helpful in generating meaningful insights. This makes it hard for the company to grow fast and deal with problems in different countries. They lost a lot of money in Latin America because they did not have a solid system to analyze their data. They need to change from using excel to a new robust system that can analyze their data better. This new system should be able to handle high volume of data, be easy for people to use and give them organized information in order to make decisions. By solving this problem, AtliQ Hardware can enhance operational efficiency, avoid potential losses and get more business in all the countries. Using a modern data analtics system will help them grow and make more profits.
