# Business-Insights-360-Case-Study
This project aims to build an automated POWER BI dashboard that would help the Finance, Sales, Marketing and Supply Chain team of AtliQ Hardware (a hypothetical company) in order to effectively analyze the data and drive business insights to incorporate data-powered decisions. 

Welcome to the business insights 360 data analysis case study as a part of the Portfolio Project of DataAnalyzer-Pooja.

# Problem Statement 
AtliQ Hardware (a hypothetical company) faces challenges in effectively using and gaining insights from their data. They currently rely on excel files for data analysis but this method is outdated and not helpful in generating meaningful insights. This hampers the company's ability to grow rapidly and overcome difficulties in different countries.

Unfortunately, AtliQ Hardware suffered a major loss in Latin America due to the lack of a robust and efficient analytics system. To address this, the company urgently needs to transition from excel files to a modern data analytics platform. Such a platform should handle the increasing data volume, offer user-friendly interfaces for data consumption, and enable the generation of actionable insights.

By solving this problem, AtliQ Hardware can enhance operational efficiency, avoid potential losses, and seize growth opportunities in all markets. Implementing a modern data analytics platform will ensure sustainable and profitable business growth for AtliQ Hardware.
